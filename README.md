Sure! Here's a professional, visually appealing `README.md` for your GitHub profile. This kind of README helps visitors quickly understand who you are, what you do, and what you're working on.

### ✅ **Steps to Set It Up**

1. **Create a repository named exactly the same as your GitHub username.**

   * For example, if your username is `awonthapaliya`, then the repository name must be `awonthapaliya`.

2. **Initialise it with a README file.**

   * When creating the repo, check the box “Initialize this repository with a README.”

3. **Paste the content below into that README.**

   * You can do this via GitHub’s online editor or clone the repo locally and update it.

4. **Commit and push if working locally.**

   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Update profile README"
   git push origin main
   ```
